## Why Accessibility Matters

Addressing accessibility can be challenging for website creators and maintainers who do not have the time, skills, or resources . Website creators need no-code tools, including CMSs, and website generators, that:

* are accessible to website creators with disabilities
* can create accessible websites

**Accessibility is required by law and is a procurement requirement** in many situations.

## Example Scenarios

The persona scenarios below are examples of accessibility issues with no-code tools.

### Everyone Can Add Blocks of Content

<p><span class="persona">Persona: </span>
 Mohamed is a cook. He is blind and uses a screen reader that reads aloud the information on his screen.
</p>
<div class="quotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><span class="issue">Problem: </span><span><q>
        I want to add a new block of content to my home page. The documentation of my tool says I need to drag and drop, but I cannot do that as I do not use the mouse. I tried using my screen readerâ€™s built-in functionality to drag and drop, but still it does not work.
      </q></span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span class="issue">Works well: </span><span><q>
        I can use the keyboard to select the block of content I want to use and then put it wherever I want on the page.
      </q></span></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

Users who have auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual disabilities need to be able to add, customize,and remove blocks of content.

### The Tool Supports the Production of Accessible Content

<p><span class="persona">Persona: </span>
  Amahle is a hairdresser. She has a small website to handle client appointments.
</p>

<div class="quotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><span class="issue">Problem: </span><span><q>
        My clients say they cannot book an appointment because my website has accessibility issues. The tool I am using does not have anything to improve the accessibility of my website.
      </q></span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span class="issue">Works well: </span><span><q>
        The tool suggests me to add headings, lists, and labels. My clients say it is very accessible.
      </q></span></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

Your users may not be able to fix accessibility issues. Your tool needs to support them when creating content so that the output is accessible. This includes making headings, paragraphs, lists, labels, and other content structures accessible.

### The Tool Supports the Creation of Accessible Multimedia Content

<p><span class="persona">Persona: </span>
  Dacso runs a mechanics shop. He has a website where he puts videos that show how they fix cars and motorbikes.
</p>
<div class="quotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><span class="issue">Problem: </span><span><q>
        I have been told that my videos are not accessible. But I don't know what it means. My tool does not give me a clue on how I should make them accessible.
      </q></span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span class="issue">Works well: </span><span><q>
        Whenever I upload a video, my tool advices me to add captions and suggests me to add transcripts and descriptions for everybody to enjoy my videos.
      </q></span></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

Your users may not have the knowledge and/or resources to create accessible multimedia content for people who cannot see and hear well or at all. Your tool needs to support the addition of alternatives for audio and video content so that people with disabilities can enjoy them.

## The Accessibility Standard to Help You

Your no-code tool is sometimes called an "authoring tool" because people use it to create websites. There is an international standard that addresses accessibility needs in no-code tools: Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG).

**Use ATAG to help make your tool**:

* **accessible to website creators (Part A)**
* **support accessible content for website consumers (Part B)**

ATAG covers the example scenarios above:

* _Everyone can add blocks of content_: [TBD]
* _Everyone can produce accessible content_: [TBD] 
* _The tool supports the creation of accessible multimedia content_: [TBD]

And ATAG covers much more.
