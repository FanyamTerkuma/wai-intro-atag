## Why Accessibility Matters

People with and without disabilities use social media to create and consume content in different environments. These include work, leisure, hobbies, and others.

If you make your social media tool accessible, you are being inclusive of people with disabilities, and your improving your tool's reputation.

People need social media that:

* is accessible to users with disabilities
* can produce accessible content

**Accessibility is required by law and is a procurement requirement** in many situations.

## Example Scenarios

The persona scenarios below are examples of accessibility issues with LMSs.

### Everyone Can Rely on your Tool

<p><span class="persona">Persona: </span>
 Banele is a community manager with low vision. She uses magnification software to increase the font size.
</p>
<div class="quotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><span class="issue">Problem: </span><span><q>
        I used to be able to manage my clientâ€™s social media profile. The  tool updated and broke most of the accessibility features. I am no longer able to do my job.
      </q></span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span class="issue">Works well: </span><span><q>
        The tool keeps being accessible update after update. If something ever breaks, I can go back to the previous version of the tool where it worked as expected.
      </q></span></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

Users who have auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual disabilities often rely on social media tools to do their job. You need to ensure accessibility is preserved when updating your tool's user interface or functionality.

### Everyone can Process Content at Their Own Pace

<p><span class="persona">Persona: </span>
  Nushi is a blind influencer with a lot of followers. He uses a screen reader that reads aloud the information on his screen.
  </p>
<div class="quotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><span class="issue">Problem: </span><span><q>
        It takes a lot of time for me to search through the comments on my posts and skip to new comments.
      </q></span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span class="issue">Works well: </span><span><q>
        I can search through comments quickly using my screen reader so I can react and reply to followers easily. 
      </q></span></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

people who interact with social media tools have different abilities. Some read and process content in different ways. Different types of assistive technologies that people use need to be able to interact with your tool.

### The Tool Supports the Creation of Accessible Social Experiences

<p><span class="persona">Persona: </span>
  Enhamed is a streamer. He has no idea about accessibility.
</p>
<div class="quotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><span class="issue">Problem: </span><span><q>
        I get complaints that my images and videos are not accessible. I can't do anything about it, my tool does not allow me to change anything in them.
      </q></span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span class="issue">Works well: </span><span><q>
        when I start streaming, the tool suggests me to add alternatives for images and videos, including captions and descriptions.
      </q></span></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

Streamers and other broadcasters need tools that can create accessible social experiences. This includes adding alternatives to images and multimedia.

## The Accessibility Standard to Help You

Your social media tool is sometimes called an "authoring tool" because people use it to share content with their family, friends, colleagues, and followers. There is an international standard that addresses accessibility needs in social media tools: Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG).

**Use ATAG to help make your tool**:

* **accessible to content creators (Part A)**
* **support accessible content for content consumers (Part B)**

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Examples" class="simple aside" %}
{:/}

ATAG covers the example scenarios above:

* _Everyone Can Rely on your Tool_ &mdash; [TBD]
* _Everyone can Process Content at Their Own Pace_ &mdash; [TBD]
* _The Tool supports the creation of accessible social experiences_ &mdash; [TBD]

And ATAG covers much more.
