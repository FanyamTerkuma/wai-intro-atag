This page introduces a standard to help you make your social media platform accessible to people with disabilities.

It includes quotes from personas (fictional users) to help you understand some aspects of accessibility specific to your tools.

## Why Accessibility Matters

Your current customers and potential new customers need social media platforms  that:

* are accessible to users with disabilities
* produce accessible content

In many situations, accessibility is required by law and is a procurement requirement.

## Examples

### Everyone CanRely on your Tool

<p class="persona"><strong>Persona: </strong>
 Banele is a blind community manager. She uses a screen reader that reads aloud the information on her screen.
</p>
<div class="quotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><span class="issue">Problem: </span><span><q>
        I used to be able to manage my clientâ€™s social media profile. The  tool updated and broke most of the accessibility features. I am no longer able to do my job.
      </q></span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span class="issue">Works well: </span><span><q>
        The tool keeps being accessible update after update. If something ever breaks, I can go back to the previous version of the tool where it worked as expected.
      </q></span></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

Users who have auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual disabilities often rely on your tool to do their job. You need to ensure accessibility is preserved when updating your tool's user interface or functionality.

### Everyone can Process Content at Their Own Pace

<p class="persona"><strong>Persona: </strong>
  Nushi is a journalisst with low vision. She uses magnification software to increase the font size.
  </p>
<div class="quotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><span class="issue">Problem: </span><span><q>
        I can't read the content in this tool. It updates so quickly that I cannot follow through.
      </q></span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span class="issue">Works well: </span><span><q>
        I can decide when the tool refreshes for new content. This way I can read at my own pace when content updates are very fast.
      </q></span></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

people who interact with social platforms have different abilities. Some need to read content at a different pace. Your tool should allow them to decide how they want to process the new content that appears.

### Everyone can Create Accessible Social Experiences

<p class="persona"><strong>Persona: </strong>
  Enhamed is a journalist. He is an authoritative source in his community, but has no idea about accessibility.
</p></
<div class="quotes">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><span class="issue">Problem: </span><span><q>
        I get complaints that links, images, and videos that I upload are not accessible. I can't do anything about it, my tool does not allow me to change anything in them.
      </q></span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span class="issue">Works well: </span><span><q>
        When I add a link, I can change its texts so that it is clear what the link is about. when I upload images and videos, the tool suggests me to add alternative texts, captions, and descriptions as appropriate.
      </q></span></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

People who post to social media need to be able to create accessible social experiences. This includes using a clear link text that explains what the link is about, as well as adding alternatives to images and multimedia.

## The Accessibility Standard to Help You

Your social media platform is an "authoring tool". It can enable users to create accessible social experiences.

There is an international standard to help you meet accessibility needs: **Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)**. ATAG is developed by the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative ([WAI](/WAI/)).

Use ATAG to help make your tool:

* accessible to content creators (Part A)
* support accessible content for content consumers (Part B)

ATAG covers the above examples:

* Everyone Can Rely on your Tool [TBD]
* Everyone can Process Content at Their Own Pace [TBD]
* Everyone can Create Accessible Social Experiences [TBD]

To get started putting ATAG to work for you, see:

* [[ATAG Overview]](/standards-guidelines/atag/), with links to the ATAG standard and implementing ATAG
* [[ATAG at a Glance]](/standards-guidelines/atag/glance/), a paraphrased summary to give you an idea of what's covered in ATAG
