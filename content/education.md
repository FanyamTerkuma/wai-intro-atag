## What do I Need to Know About Accessibility?

"I am a blind professor. I need an accessible LMS tool to create accessible materials for my students."

An LMS allows professors, lecturers, and other instructors to author training materials. If you develop or maintain an LMS, you can make it:

* accessible to authors with disabilities, and
* capable of producing accessible content.

W3C WAI's Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) tell you how to do it. For more info on ATAG requirements, see : [[Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) Overview]](/standards-guidelines/atag/)

"With my screen reader, I can use the tool to create accessible resource materials and assignments. I can preview the results all within the tool."

[[Description]]

"The tool generates accessible content for my students. When there is an accessibility issue, the tool guides me to fix it."

[[Description]]

"When I need to use images and multimedia content in my courses, the tool suggests to include alternatives, such as description, transcripts, and captions."

[[Description]]

"The tool enables me to track students progress and assess their knowledge.
